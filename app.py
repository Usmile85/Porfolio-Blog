st.write("""
Gold has historically functioned as a financial anchor — an asset that investors turn to in times of uncertainty, inflation, or currency instability. Between 2005 and 2025, the price of gold rose from roughly $445 per ounce to over $3,300 per ounce, driven by key global events.

The 2008 financial crisis marked the first major surge, followed by another rally during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. More recently, concerns about inflation, fiat currency debasement, and geopolitical tensions have fueled gold’s continued appreciation.

This trend reinforces the idea that gold is not just a commodity — it's a signal of market sentiment. For data scientists and fintech professionals, tracking assets like gold provides deeper context when modeling risk, predicting inflation, or assessing macroeconomic impacts.
